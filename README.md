##Welcome to EmailRank

Email rank is a web app that inputs email text and predicts corporate authority of sender and recipient based on text features.

Key components:
/Model Building:
1. Email Processing Ipython Notebook: Processes Raw Data and saves for use in models
2. Model Processing Ipython Notebook: Train models based on data for use in app

/Flaskapp
1. app.py: contains the code to run this app on localhost:8080
2. NOTE: Model files & raw data were too big to include on github due to 100mb so they will need to be retrained to run code
